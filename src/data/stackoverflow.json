If I comment out this line the default font appears vertically centered fine. But changing to the custom font breaks the vertical alignment. I'm getting the same issue on a Table Cell with a custom font too. Do I need to tell the view somewhere that the custom font is not as tall as other fonts? EDIT: I've just realized that the font I'm using is a Windows TrueType Font. I can use it fine in TextEdit on the Mac only a problem with the alignment in my App"

People come in, want a 50 page website designed from scratch, branded, built on a CMS, and programmed with lots of forms, Java functionality (simple jQuery stuff usually), and SEO and expect to pay $1000. When people like this come about, it's the professionals job to educate the client and help others understand how much really goes into development. Looking at a \"simple\" app or website that they'll spend minutes on (or more in some cases) makes it very easy to think, \"Well it took me 60 seconds to navigate this page OR I picked this game up in a few minutes and beat the first couple levels, therefore it must have been simple to build.\""
